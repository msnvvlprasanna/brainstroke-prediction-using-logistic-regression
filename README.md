# brainstroke-prediction-using-logistic-regression
 Predicting brain stroke by using general factors or details like gender,age,blood pressure,place(rural,urban),work type,stroke occurance,etc....
By taking into consideration of these factors,we will predict whether a person will get a brain stroke or not  by using logistic regression  machine learning algorithm.
  
    This project proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting brain stroke using logistic regression algorithm. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of demographic, clinical, and lifestyle attributes, the model identifies significant risk factors and generates accurate predictions. The proposed system offers improved accuracy, interpretability, and scalability, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and provide timely interventions to high-risk patients, ultimately reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with brain stroke.
   A machine learning-based brain stroke prediction system is proposed, utilizing logistic regression algorithm. Analyzing demographic, clinical, and lifestyle attributes, the model accurately predicts stroke risk, enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.

###**LOGISTIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM**###
   Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the target variable is categorical and has only two possible outcomes. It works by modeling the probability of the positive class using a logistic function, which maps the input features to a probability between 0 and 1.
